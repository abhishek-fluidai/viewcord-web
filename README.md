# Viewcord
Viewcord is a completely new way to experience YouTube. It is an open-source project. 
We want to create a front for YouTube that is different, more Privacy-friendly and easier to use.

This project seeks to enhance the user experience on YouTube by removing all the Ads and tracking elements from the interface and at the same time adding features that will make for a better video-watching experience for users.
